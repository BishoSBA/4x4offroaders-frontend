## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, reactrouter, tailwind, node.js, express, mongoDB, oauth2

### Frontend:
* Uses React for frontend framework
* Tailwind for CSS and using DaisyUI for styled components

### Backend:
* Utilizes express, a minimalistic node.js framework to create robust API
* Connects with MongoDB for data storage and using mongoose for object data modeling
* Uses passport for local and google authentication strategies

## Optimizations
* Add a page to add new posts
* Add a page to see all posts of a certain user (profile page)
* Add Loading animation
* Sorting option for feed (Newest, Oldest, Popular)


## Lessons Learned:

* Work on a project of passion with a long-term vision
